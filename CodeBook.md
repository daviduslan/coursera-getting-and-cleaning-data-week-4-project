# Code Book for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This is the code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data.

# Source Data
A full description of the original data used in this project can be found at [The UCI Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). 

[Here is the source data used](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) prior to the transformations described in the next sections.

Visit the links above for information about the original data set and attributes. This codebook will focus on any transformations done.

# Transformations Done on Source Data

Source data files:
- features.txt
- activity_labels.txt
- subject_train.txt
- x_train.txt
- y_train.txt
- subject_test.txt
- x_test.txt
- y_test.txt

1. Load activity labels and features for manipulation
2. Create vector to allow for extracting only the data on mean and standard deviation and to clean up the variable names 
3. Load all the test and train datasets into a single vector to prep for merging into a single dataframe
4. Merge the two datasets and add field names, apply vector from step 2 to only get mean/stdev data
5. Convert activities and subjects into factors
* This is to replace IDs with descriptive activity names
6. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject: "tidy.txt"

# Summary of Data in tidy.txt
This section lists and describes the data available in the final output file: tidy.txt.

## Identifiers

* `subject` - The ID of the test subject
* `activity` - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken

## Activity Labels

* `WALKING` (value `1`): subject was walking during the test
* `WALKING_UPSTAIRS` (value `2`): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
* `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS` (value `3`): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
* `SITTING` (value `4`): subject was sitting during the test
* `STANDING` (value `5`): subject was standing during the test
* `LAYING` (value `6`): subject was laying down during the test

## Measurements
These are the final resulting column names. For more info on each measurement, please refer to the Source Data section above and see details on the original data.
